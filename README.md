Exploring Haskell, the language.

## Setup and Installation

1. https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html
2. Add the extracted directory `/bin` to **System** > **Advanced system settings** > **Environment Variables**.

`ghci` is the [interactive environment](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/ghci.html).

## Helpful Resources

1. https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/indextutorial.html - bit out of date, PDF included in the root dir.
2. https://wiki.haskell.org/Keywords

## Fun Facts

1. The `Curry Paradox` (`Curry Compounds`) I address in some papers is named after Haskell Curry.
2. The same Haskell Curry the language is named after.
3. The same Haskell Curry that `"Currying"` is named after.
